# C Text Editor
This is a simple C text editor that I am building in order to better understand C / Linux. Beware there is a ton of commenting in this code in order for me to better understand / remember what is actually going on, so it may not be pretty.

## Some Goals
I have a few goals that I would like to accomplish once the main text editor is done. These include:
- Line numbers
- Modal editing (vim-like insert / normal mode)
- multiple buffers
